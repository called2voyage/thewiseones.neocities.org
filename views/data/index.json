  "long_bio": "The Wise Ones is dedicated to the exploration of a certain archetype in fictional media, usually embodied by older individuals, that has produced some of the most celebrated characters. Characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Gandalf, and the Doctor embody certain ideals of wisdom, and we want to examine the different ways these characters are crafted and portrayed. There exists a darker foil to this archetype embodied in characters like Palpatine, Saruman, and the Master, that we are also interested in here. The Wise Ones is part fan project and part literary criticism. We should be releasing our first character examination soon &mdash; stay tuned!"
